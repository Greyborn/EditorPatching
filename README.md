# Harmony Editor Patching

This project is forked from [needle-tools/editorpatching](https://github.com/needle-tools/editorpatching).

***It currently depends on private library references, and direct use is not recommended. The original Needle project is recommended over this one.***

While it includes mostly aesthetic tweaks, there are a few fixes:

- `EditorPatchProvider` patch state is now saved correctly.
- The "ping" method now attempts to locate the patch file, assembly, or package before generating a failure log message.

Aesthetic changes include:
- Harmony assembly infomation now appears in the panel header.
- Patch metadata was moved from a tooltip to a featured box below the patch name.
- Patch name functions as a button to ping the patch file or assembly, and the mouse cursor now changes when hovering over the label.
- The location of the provider in the Project Settings window changed from "Needle/Editor Patching" to "Harmony".
- The settings filename changed "EditorPatchingSettings" to "HarmonyPatchSettings".

> **NOTE**: The `SlideToggle` control is from a package that's currently in a private registry. While it will likely be made public at some point, in the meantime, the control could easily be replaced with another control, such as `GUI.Toggle(rect, oldValue, string.Empty)`).
